# Trip live location + free voice calling — design

> Date: 2026-08-31
> Status: awaiting user review
> Supersedes-in-part: `docs/SLIPPY_TRIP_FULL_LOOP_CLAUDE_HANDOFF.md` §8 (schema), §9 Phase 3 & Phase 5, §6.5 (VoIP provider) — this spec makes the decisions that document left open and scopes them into one buildable slice.

## 1. Why

The user wants trip companions to be able to (a) stay in voice contact and (b) see each other's live position while traveling, "แบบ walky talky" — so a group never loses track of each other, without depending on any external app. Both features already exist as *planned but disabled* work in the codebase (`web/src/lib/trips/trip-features.ts` — `TRIP_FEATURE_LIVE_LOCATION` and `TRIP_FEATURE_CALLS`, both gated off) and as a fully-specified but decision-incomplete roadmap in the handoff doc above. This spec closes the three decisions that doc left open and turns Phase 3 + Phase 5 of that roadmap into one implementation plan.

## 2. Decisions locked in this session

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| VoIP provider | **LiveKit Cloud** | Recommended by the existing handoff doc; generous free tier; open-source core keeps a self-hosted fallback available if usage grows past free-tier cost. |
| Location sharing mode | **Foreground-only, opt-in, time-boxed sessions** | No `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription` entitlement, no special App Store background-location review, matches the handoff doc's own non-negotiable privacy rules (§2) with the least new attack surface. |
| Call media | **Voice only** | Simpler permission surface (no camera), lower bandwidth for travelers on patchy roaming/hotel wifi, ships faster. Video can be added later behind the same LiveKit room without a redesign. |

Everything below assumes these three choices; it does not re-litigate them.

## 3. Non-negotiable rules (unchanged from the handoff doc §2 — repeated here because they drive every schema/UI choice below)

- No coordinate is ever transmitted before the user explicitly starts a session.
- Sharing is trip-scoped, visible while active (to the sharer, via a persistent indicator), and stoppable in one tap.
- Sharing always has an expiry. Supported durations: 15 min, 1 hour, 4 hours, until end of day. No "forever" option.
- A trip owner/admin can never remotely turn on another member's location.
- Only the latest position is retained — no location history table, no timeline.
- Removing a trip member immediately revokes their access to both location data and call rooms.
- No call audio is recorded or stored, ever.
- VoIP/location provider secrets (`LIVEKIT_API_SECRET`, etc.) exist only in server env vars — never shipped to Web, iOS, or Expo bundles.

## 4. Data model (new, additive migration — does not touch any existing table)

### `trip_location_sessions`
```
id            uuid pk
journey_id    uuid  references life_journeys(id) on delete cascade
user_id       uuid  references auth.users(id)
started_at    timestamptz default now()
expires_at    timestamptz not null        -- started_at + chosen duration
stopped_at    timestamptz null            -- set when the user taps Stop early
created_at    timestamptz default now()
```
One row per sharing session. "Active" = `stopped_at is null and expires_at > now()`.

### `trip_member_locations`
```
session_id    uuid pk references trip_location_sessions(id) on delete cascade
journey_id    uuid  references life_journeys(id) on delete cascade  -- denormalized for RLS simplicity
user_id       uuid  references auth.users(id)
latitude      double precision not null
longitude     double precision not null
accuracy_m    real
heading       real
speed_mps     real
recorded_at   timestamptz not null
```
`session_id` as primary key, not a surrogate id: latest-position-only per the retention rule above means every position update is an `UPSERT ... ON CONFLICT (session_id) DO UPDATE`, never an insert of a new row. There is deliberately no location history to query, back up, or leak.

RLS on both tables: `journey_id` must be a trip the requesting `auth.uid()` is an active participant of (`left_at is null`), reusing the exact membership check `getTripAccess()` already applies to chat/expenses — no new authorization concept.

A `pg_cron` job (5-minute cadence) deletes `trip_location_sessions` rows where `expires_at < now() - interval '1 hour'` (cascades to `trip_member_locations`) — the 1-hour grace window is only so a client that reconnects moments after expiry can still show "sharing ended," not so stale data lingers indefinitely.

### `trip_call_sessions`
```
id                uuid pk
journey_id        uuid references life_journeys(id) on delete cascade
conversation_id   uuid references trip conversation (existing table from trip-conversation.ts)
room_name         text not null           -- LiveKit room identifier, derived from id
initiator_id      uuid references auth.users(id)
status            text not null           -- 'ringing' | 'active' | 'ended' | 'missed'
started_at        timestamptz default now()
ended_at          timestamptz null
```
No participant list, no per-user join/leave log beyond what's needed to render call history without audio — matches the handoff doc's "no call recording occurs" rule by not even structurally supporting it.

## 5. Realtime transport

Both location updates and call ringing/state changes ride the **same** private-per-trip Supabase Realtime channel the chat system already opens for that trip's conversation (`trip:{journey_id}`), as two new event types (`location_update`, `call_state`) rather than a parallel channel — one less thing to secure, one less thing to reconnect on network loss. Per the handoff doc §6.3, this channel must have RLS on `realtime.messages` and public channel access disabled; that's already required infrastructure, not new to this feature.

## 6. Location — client flow

1. User opens the trip map, taps "แชร์ตำแหน่ง" (Share location).
2. Picks a duration (15m / 1h / 4h / rest of day) from a sheet — the sheet **is** the consent UI; there is no separate settings toggle to forget about.
3. Client inserts a `trip_location_sessions` row, requests `CLLocationManager` (`.whenInUse`) / browser `Geolocation` permission if not already granted, and starts posting an upsert every ~10–15s while the app/tab is foregrounded.
4. A persistent small banner ("กำลังแชร์ตำแหน่ง · เหลือ 42 นาที · หยุด") stays visible on every screen while a session is active — this is the "visible while active" rule, not just a map-screen detail.
5. Other trip members see a distinct avatar pin (not a numbered itinerary pin) on the existing `TripMapView`/`trip-map.tsx`, with a live-updating "last seen Xs ago" and a greyed-out "stale" treatment once an update is >60s old (connection dropped, app backgrounded, etc. — the doc's "offline/stale must never look like currently live" rule).
6. Session ends when: the user taps Stop, `expires_at` passes (client stops posting; other clients grey the pin out once the server-side expiry has passed, not just on the sharer's local clock), or the member leaves the trip.

No map redesign — this reuses the `TripMapView`/`trip-map.tsx` components already fixed this session, adding one more pin type and one banner.

## 7. Calling — client flow

1. A "โทร" (Call) button lives next to the trip's existing group chat entry point.
2. Tapping it calls `POST /api/trips/[id]/calls/token`, which: verifies the caller is an active trip member (existing `getTripAccess()`), creates a `trip_call_sessions` row (`status: 'ringing'`), asks the LiveKit server SDK for a short-lived join token scoped to that room, and broadcasts a `call_state: ringing` event on the trip's Realtime channel.
3. Other online members see an incoming-call UI; on iOS this arrives as a **CallKit** native call screen via a **PushKit** VoIP push (so it rings even if Slippy is backgrounded or the phone is locked) — this is why a VoIP APNs auth key is required (§9 below); on Web it's an in-app banner (browsers cannot ring outside an open tab).
4. Accepting connects to the LiveKit room with the same token flow; declining/timing out flips `status` to `missed`.
5. Ending the call (either side, or all participants leaving the room) sets `status: 'ended'`, `ended_at`, and releases the microphone — call history shows who called whom and for how long, never what was said.

## 8. What the assistant will implement directly

- Migration: the three tables above, RLS, `pg_cron` cleanup job.
- `POST /api/trips/[id]/calls/token`, `POST/DELETE /api/trips/[id]/location-sessions`, `POST /api/trips/[id]/location-sessions/[id]/ping` — all reusing `getTripAccess()`.
- Web: share-location sheet + persistent banner + map pin type; call button + LiveKit `livekit-client` integration; flip `Permissions-Policy` from `microphone=(), geolocation=()` to `microphone=(self), geolocation=(self)`; extend CSP `connect-src`/`img-src` for the LiveKit Cloud project's WSS/HTTPS hosts.
- iOS: same share-location flow with `CLLocationManager`; LiveKit Swift SDK + CallKit/PushKit call flow; `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` and `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` strings (no `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription` — foreground-only, per §2 above).
- Tests: RLS/authorization tests for the new routes (non-member cannot fetch a call token or read another trip's locations) using the same injectable-`db` pattern as `medications.test.mjs`; a fake-LiveKit-client unit test for the token route's membership gate.

## 9. What only the user can do (accounts, billing, Apple entitlements — the assistant cannot create third-party accounts or spend money)

1. Create a LiveKit Cloud account/project; copy `LIVEKIT_URL`, `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`, `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET` into server-only env vars.
2. In Apple Developer, for `app.slippy.ios`: enable **Push Notifications** and **Background Modes → Voice over IP**; generate a VoIP APNs authentication key (`.p8`) and store it in a secret manager (never commit it).
3. Decide (can defer): whether to also enable `TRIP_FEATURE_LIVE_LOCATION` / `TRIP_FEATURE_CALLS` in staging before production, per the existing feature-flag convention in `trip-features.ts`.

## 10. Explicitly out of scope for this slice

- Background location tracking (would need `NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription`, a much heavier App Review conversation, and a battery-drain review — revisit only if foreground sessions prove insufficient in real use).
- Video calling (same LiveKit room supports it later; not built now per the voice-only decision).
- Location history/trails, geofencing, or "meet me here" routing.
- SOS/Safety Hub (handoff doc Phase 4) — a related but separate feature; not bundled into this slice.
- Group calls beyond what LiveKit gives "for free" by being a multi-party room (no special mesh/SFU tuning work planned).

## 11. Acceptance criteria (adapted from the handoff doc §10)

- No coordinate is ever transmitted before the sharing sheet's explicit start action.
- The sharing banner is visible on every screen, not just the map, for the whole active session.
- Stopping, or letting the session expire, is reflected for other members within one Realtime tick — no polling delay.
- A user removed from a trip immediately loses read access to that trip's `trip_member_locations` and cannot mint a call token for it, verified by an integration test, not just RLS existing.
- A call token is only ever issued to a verified active member; the route returns the same 404-shaped "not found" the rest of the app uses for unauthorized trip access (per `trip-features.ts`'s existing convention), not a 403 that would confirm the trip exists.
- Ending a call — from either side — releases the microphone within one UI frame on both platforms.
- No audio is stored anywhere; call history rows contain no media reference.
