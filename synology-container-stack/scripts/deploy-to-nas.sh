# synology-container-stack/docker-compose.yml builds web/api with
# `context: ..`, i.e. it needs web/, api/, package.json, package-lock.json
# etc. present alongside synology-container-stack/ on the NAS side too.
#
# Uses `tar | ssh ... tar -x` instead of rsync. macOS (Sequoia+) ships
# Apple's `openrsync` instead of GNU rsync — it speaks an older protocol
# (29) that doesn't reliably interop with the GNU rsync on Synology DSM,
# failing with a confusing "Permission denied, please try again" that looks
# like an SSH auth problem but isn't. tar+ssh only needs the things we've
# already confirmed work (plain ssh, plain tar), so it's the more portable
# choice here even though it loses rsync's incremental-transfer speed.
#
# Note: this does NOT delete files on the NAS that no longer exist in the
# source (rsync --delete would). Good enough for this stack's size; if repo
# structure changes significantly, clean the NAS path manually first.
